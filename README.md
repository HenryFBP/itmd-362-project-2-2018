## Booking System:

We will be building (as discussed by H, J, and R on 02/42) a movie ticket-buying
site, like Fandango.

We will try to avoid merge conflicts as much as possible by having someone post
what they're going to be doing on Slack whenever they start.

In addition to that, we will also modularize the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML as
much as possible to further the 'separation of concerns' mentality.

JavaScript features will be designed intentionally to ONLY enhance the features
of our web interface and will (as much as possible) NOT be required to interact
with our site.

## Major Features:

- Javascript-enhanced filtering, system for tickets by prices, date, showtime,
  etc.
- Javascript-enhanced seat-chooser
- Mobile-friendly ticket-choosing

## Notes:

- If we were allowed to use Django, JAX/JSPs/Containers, or some other
  serverside technology, the `.html` pages' data content would NOT be hardcoded,
  but they will be because those are not part of the project.
