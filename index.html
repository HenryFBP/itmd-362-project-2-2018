            Here's the epic saga of cows vs aliens, in higher resolution and
            widescreen.

          <p>
            When I first uploaded it in 2007, youtube had a maximum video quality
            of 240p, and the compression looked like someone had chewed up the
            video and spat it out. That has always bothered me with this video, so
            here it is again with more pixels. I also went to the trouble of
            extending it to 16:9 and fixed a few bits, which was a lot more work
            than I anticipated.
